## Part 1
Today we are extendning ROS nodes over serial to Arduinos. This is done with `rosserial`. To install this use:

```
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial-arduino
$ sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rosserial

```

Initially we are using a simple blink sketch on the arduino, this is found the the `Arduino` folder of this directory. Compile and upload this sketch to the arduino. Once upload has compleeted start roserial with the correct port.

```
